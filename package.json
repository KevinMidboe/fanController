Using motors to control crazy mondane things. *Not because it was hard, but because I could.* So to continue that trend I wanted to be able to control me two roller curtains over my bed. I started prototyping with a Arduino and a couple servos and I now have it up and running.  >A little caviate. It is working, but only the one curtain can be lifted again, it has no automation and no wireless connectivity. Needs to be done!",
