# C.H.I.P. | Fan Controller

This project uses node.js as backend and python for GPIO controll to toggle a relay hooked up to my bathroom ventilation fan. I felt the need to build this project so I can remotely controll my fan instead of manually going and switching off the fan. Setup is easy and I will be creating a version that will work for Raspberry PÃ­ GPIO pins aswell. 

## Setup
First you need to set a static IP address for the device you are using, guide can be found here: LINK.

For me: Create setup script for installing node packages and database. 

## Installation
There is two files that may be changed for this to work for you.
